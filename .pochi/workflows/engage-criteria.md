Pochi is an AI-powered coding agent integrated into IDEs, designed to boost developer productivity through autonomous coding workflows, code generation, debugging, and project-wide refactoring. It targets individual developers and teams, offering a BYOK model for data privacy and flexibility. 

- Competitors: Cursor, GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit, Aider, Tabnine, or leadership from OpenAI/Anthropic discussing AI coding tools.

- Goal: Identify X posts for authentic, value-adding replies that align with Pochi’s value prop (enhancing developer productivity via AI-driven coding automation), maximize engagement (likes/replies), and avoid competition or brand risks.

## 1. Automatic SKIP Conditions (Check First!)
Immediately SKIP and don’t score if ANY apply:
- Competitors: Mentions, promotions, or posts by leadership from Cursor, GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit, Aider, Tabnine, or OpenAI/Anthropic (when about AI coding tools).
- Low Visibility: <1K views OR posted >48 hours ago.
- High Competition: >50 replies.
- Irrelevant Topics: Non-coding AI (e.g., vision, content creation, design, personal productivity) OR non-developer topics (e.g., crypto, automotive, lifestyle, office aesthetics, non-technical memes).
- Over-Engagement: Engaged with user >3 times/week (track to avoid spam).
- Personal/Off-Prop: Too personal (e.g., individual stories without dev relevance) OR anti-AI sentiments contradicting Pochi’s focus.

If all pass, score below.

## 2. Scoring Categories (Out of 6)

Evaluate posts that pass skips. Focus: AI coding tools, dev productivity, workflows, frustrations.


**2.1 Engagement Score (3 points)**
Evaluate posts that pass skips. Focus: AI coding tools, dev productivity, workflows, frustrations.
- 2/2: >10K views AND >100 likes OR 10-50 replies, <30 replies competition, <24h old.
- 1/2: 1K-10K views OR 50-100 likes/<10 replies, <48h old.
- 0/2: Barely meets minimum, no other issues.

Evaluates how well the post’s audience and topic align with Pochi’s target market (developers) and focus (coding automation, productivity, AI tools).
- 3/3: Direct dev audience AND core topic (e.g., AI coding workflows, code generation, debugging, dev productivity, coding frustrations).
- 2/3: Dev audience OR tangential topic (e.g., hiring/freelance dev life, open-source dynamics, technical coding automation).
- 1/3: Broad tech audience OR loose topic (e.g., general software, non-coding tools).
- 0/3: Should’ve been skipped (non-dev or off-topic).

**2.3 Engagement Opportunity (2 points)**
