This criteria list is designed to evaluate Twitter (X) posts for engagement opportunities for Pochi, a coding automation tool targeting developers. The goal is to identify posts where Pochi can add value, align with its value proposition (enhancing developer productivity through AI-driven coding automation), and engage authentically with minimal competition.
Scoring Categories

Each category is scored out of a maximum number of points, contributing to a total engagement score (out of 10). The score determines whether to engage, with specific thresholds for action.

**1. Engagement Score (3 points)**
Measures the post's reach and interaction level to assess visibility potential.
- 3/3: High reach (>50K views) AND strong engagement (>500 likes OR >50 replies) OR moderate reach (20K–50K views) with low competition (<20 replies). Fresh (posted within 24 hours).
- 2/3: Decent reach (10K–20K views) OR moderate engagement (100–500 likes, 10–50 replies) with low competition (<30 replies). Posted within 48 hours.
- 1/3: Low reach (<10K views) OR minimal engagement (<100 likes, <10 replies) OR older than 48 hours.
- 0/3: Negligible reach (<1K views) OR no engagement (<10 likes, <5 replies) OR older than 72 hours.

**Common Issues to Avoid in This Category:**
- Too many replies or high competition (>50 replies) can mean missed golden hour (reply within 1-3 hours for optimal engagement). Deduct 1 point if reply time is too long.


  
**2. Audience Relevance (3 points)**
Evaluates how well the post’s audience and topic align with Pochi’s target market (developers) and focus (coding automation, productivity, AI tools).
- 3/3: Direct developer audience AND highly relevant topic (e.g., AI tools for coding workflows, code generation, debugging assistance, developer productivity workflows, coding automation, or technical frustrations with development processes).
- 2/3: Developer audience OR tangentially relevant topic (e.g., hiring practices, freelance developer life or open-source community dynamics).
- 1/3: Broad tech audience but not developer-focused OR unrelated topic (e.g., consumer apps, corporate strategy, non-coding automation like web scraping).
- 0/3: Completely unrelated audience (e.g., crypto, automotive, lifestyle) OR AI applications outside coding/development contexts (e.g., AI vision, content creation, design tools, personal productivity AI) OR off-topic for Pochi's value proposition (e.g., office aesthetics, non-technical discussions).

**Common Issues to Avoid in This Category:**
- Not coding-specific AI: Skip AI applications for vision, content creation, design, personal use - only engage with AI tools specifically for coding/development
- Quite personal sharing: Skip if the post is too personal (e.g., individual stories without broader dev relevance), as it may not align with audience resonance.
- Engaged with person too often: Track past interactions; skip if you've engaged with the same user more than 3 times in a week to avoid over-engagement.
- Engage with leadership roles from competitor companies: Skip to avoid brand risk; treat as competitors.



**3. Engagement Opportunity (2 points)**
Assesses the ability to craft a natural, anti-promotional reply that aligns with Pochi’s value proposition without feeling forced.
- 2/2: Topic directly aligns with Pochi’s value prop (e.g., AI coding benefits, developer productivity, eliminating busy work) AND allows a value-driven reply that resonates with the post’s insight.
- 1/2: Topic is tangentially relevant (e.g., general AI applications, freelance autonomy, technical hiring) but requires careful framing to connect to coding automation.
- 0/2: No natural connection to coding automation or developer productivity (e.g., corporate strategy, unrelated automation types, or purely promotional posts).

**Common Issues to Avoid in This Category:**
- Against what Pochi is designed for: Skip if the post contradicts Pochi's focus on productivity (e.g., anti-AI sentiments or non-coding tools).
- Selection of posts: Prioritize posts allowing engaging, value-driven replies (e.g., questions, insights, humor) to boost engagement potential.



**4. Red Flags (-1 or -2 points)**
Identifies potential risks that could harm Pochi’s brand or make engagement ineffective.
- -1 point: Controversial topic (e.g., divisive technical debates like “libraries vs AI-generated code”) OR slightly off-topic audience/use case OR high reply competition (>50 replies).
- -2 points: Completely wrong audience (e.g., crypto, consumer apps) OR promotional content with no discussion hook OR irrelevant topic (e.g., office design, non-technical memes).
- 0 points: No red flags—clean discussion, relevant audience, and low competition.

**Total Score and Verdict**
The total score (out of 8) determines the engagement decision:
- 7-8 (DEFINITELY ENGAGE): High alignment with Pochi’s audience and value prop, strong engagement metrics, low competition, and no red flags. Reply with a value-driven, anti-promotional comment that builds on the post’s insight.
- 5–6 (GOOD TARGET): Solid alignment with developer audience or topic, decent engagement, and minimal red flags. Engage with a carefully crafted reply to subtly connect to Pochi’s value prop.
- 3–4 (MAYBE/PASS): Partial relevance or challenging connection to Pochi’s focus. Consider skipping unless the engagement metrics are exceptional and a natural reply is feasible.
- 0–2 (SKIP): Misaligned audience, irrelevant topic, or significant red flags. Avoid engagement to focus on better opportunities.

**Focus Areas for Pochi**
Prioritize posts about:
- Developer frustrations (e.g., repetitive tasks, debugging pain).
- Coding workflows and productivity challenges.
- AI coding tools and their practical applications.
- Open-source community dynamics or technical automation.
- Freelance developer autonomy or meaningful work.

Avoid posts about:
- Non-developer audiences (e.g., crypto, consumer apps).
- Unrelated automation types (e.g., web scraping, office management).
- Corporate strategy or non-technical topics (e.g., office aesthetics).
- Highly controversial or divisive technical debates.
