## Objective
Define rules for identifying X posts to engage with and crafting replies that align with Pochi’s value prop (per `pochi-info.md`), maximize engagement, and avoid risks.

## 1. SKIP Conditions (MUST Check First!)
Immediately SKIP and don’t score if ANY apply:
- Competitors: Post, quoted content, or thread mentions any competitor tools, companies, or models (per pochi-info.md, e.g., Claude, Cursor) in any context related to AI coding or tools. Examples: “Tried Claude Code,” “Cursor’s debugging.” Skip if implying competitors (e.g., 'closed source models' in competitive context).
- Low Visibility: <1K views OR posted >48 hours ago.
- High Competition: >50 replies.
- Irrelevant Topics: Non-coding AI (e.g., vision, content creation, design, personal productivity) OR non-developer topics (e.g., crypto, automotive, lifestyle, office aesthetics, non-technical memes).  Examples: “New voice AI model,” “AI for music generation.”
- Over-Engagement: Engaged with user >3 times/week (track in `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- Personal/Off-Prop: Too personal (e.g., individual stories without dev relevance) OR anti-AI sentiments contradicting Pochi’s focus.
- Non-coding AI: Story writing, visual content creation, music generation, image generation, voice AI, design tools, personal productivity apps
- Platform/Infrastructure: Terminal platforms, desktop apps, unless specifically about coding workflows
- Creative Tools: Writing tools, content creation, video editing, design software
- Comment Bait/Engagement Farming: Posts explicitly soliciting replies for incentives (e.g., 'reply with X and I’ll fast-track you' or similar calls-to-action designed to farm comments/views without genuine discussion value).
- Subtle Overlaps/Conflicts: Posts discussing features or tools that could indirectly compete with or undermine Pochi’s positioning (e.g., native VS Code updates overlapping with Pochi’s extension, or posts from founders of partially overlapping tools like OpenCode unless the topic aligns with Pochi’s core value prop).
- Repeated Analysis: Skip if the post appears in the current session’s timeline and was already evaluated and logged in prior days, even if metrics have updated slightly.

If all pass, score below.

## 2. Scoring Categories (Out of 6)
For non-skipped posts, score based on alignment with Pochi’s focus (per `pochi-info.md`). 
Aim for at least 3 posts scoring 4-6 per session to meet engagement objectives. Prioritize posts with strong developer relevance (e.g., AI coding workflows) and actionable reply opportunities."

**2.1 Engagement Score (2 points)**
- 2/2: >10K views AND >100 likes OR 10-50 replies, <30 replies competition, <24h old.
- 1/2: 1K-10K views OR 50-100 likes/<10 replies, <48h old.
- 0/2: Barely meets minimum, no other issues.
  
**2.2 Audience & Topic Relevance (3 points)**
- 3/3: Direct dev audience AND core topic (e.g., AI coding workflows, code generation, debugging, dev productivity, coding frustrations).
- 2/3: Dev audience OR tangential topic (e.g., hiring/freelance dev life, open-source dynamics, technical coding automation).
- 1/3: Broad tech audience OR loose topic (e.g., general software, non-coding tools). Examples: “AI for documentation.”
- 0/3: Should’ve been skipped.

**2.3 Engagement Opportunity (2 points)**
- 1/1: Clear hook for non-promo reply (e.g., question, insight, humor tying to Pochi’s prop).
- 0/1: Forced or no value add (e.g., coding tie-in on voice AI).

**2.4 Total Score and Verdict**
- 5-6: DEFINITELY ENGAGE—Craft reply per guidelines below.
- 3-4: GOOD TARGET—Engage if low effort, natural fit.
- 1-2: MAYBE/PASS—Skip unless exceptional (e.g., KOL with huge reach).
- 0: SKIP

Prioritize: Dev frustrations, AI coding tools/workflows, open-source dynamics.

Avoid: Consumer apps, corporate strategy, divisive debates.

## 3. Reply Guidelines
- Natural Mentions: Mention Pochi only when relevant (e.g., VS Code workflows, AI coding). Avoid forced promotion or competitor mentions.
- Value-Driven: Show understanding of developer topics (e.g., VS Code, OSS, productivity) with resonant insights/questions.
- Audience Resonance: Target VS Code users, OSS contributors, and teams with concise, relatable replies.
- Subtle Alignment: Connect to Pochi’s value prop (per pochi-info.md) without sounding salesy.
- Concise and Natural: 1-2 sentences, max 280 characters, punchy.
- Threading: Consider follow-up reply if original poster responds and score ≥4.
- Engaging Structure: Use questions, insights, or light humor. Start with a hook (e.g., “Spot-on!”). End with a question to spark conversation.
- Human Tone: Sound relatable—avoid jargon, AI-like responses, or ads-heavy tone. Use casual language, emojis sparingly (e.g., “I’ve been there!”).
- Timing: Reply within 1-3 hours of post for max visibility.
- Pochi Positioning: Align mentions to core features (per pochi-info.md: VS Code extension, BYOK, cloud services). Do NOT position as CLI-only, no-code, or general automation. Verify: “Does this accurately reflect Pochi?” If not, omit mention

## 4. Reply Issues to Avoid

- Jargony phrasing: Keep language simple and developer-relatable, no overly technical terms unless necessary.
- Too AI-like, not human-like: Write as a dev would—use casual language, emojis sparingly, and personal touches (e.g., "I've been there!").
- Too lengthy: Stick to 1-2 sentences; trim for punchiness.
- Too ads-heavy tone: Subtle Pochi mentions only; focus on value/insight first.
- Not funny or optimized for engagement: Incorporate humor (e.g., light self-deprecation or relatable joke) or questions to boost likes/replies.
- Forced relevance: Don’t tie non-coding topics (e.g., voice AI) to coding workflows.
- Wrong positioning: Don’t misrepresent Pochi (e.g., as CLI-only or no-code).

## 5. Context Rules

- **Competitors**: Skip - focus on better opportunities. Avoid engaging with leadership from competitor companies.
- **KOLs**: Thoughtful insights, subtle alignment. Avoid over-engagement (e.g., more than 3 times/week per KOL).  
- **Regular devs**: Can mention Pochi when natural. Avoid over-engagement with the same user.


## 6. Examples

**6.1 Good Examples**

Post: "Built a CLI with @aisdk/@vercel AI Gateway. Thinking text animation in ANSI, set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY and works, 100s of models. It's like a mini-claude, purpose built for quickly running commands. Has some nice safety measures built-in. Used this as my learning exercise for the AI Gateway, which was absolutely delightful… I'm a fan"
Reply: "Pochi's cli is also built on top of @aisdk and @bunjavascript, it's amazing how easy we can integrate with different model providers easily"

---
Post: "This is what I am working on. Toad. A universal interface for agentic coding in the terminal. Follow me for updates. https://willmcgugan.github.io/announcing-toad/"
Reply: "Super cool! Would it be possible to extend it to support other terminal AI coding tools, e.g aider?"

---
Post: "Let's compare OpenAI gpt-oss and Qwen-3 on maths & reasoning:"
Reply: "Love this approach! Evaluation is arguably the most critical, and most overlooked, piece in LLM development."

---
Post: "Updated our human-in-the-loop recipe and example to v5! Human-in-the-Loop Agent with Next.js. Add a human approval step to your agentic system with Next.js and the AI SDK"
Reply: "Have been working on Pochi to upgrade to v5 for serveral weeks - so far it looks pretty scary!"

---
Post: "Introducing Dashboards. A single, modular view to monitor key metrics."
Reply: "Amazing! A new look to start our daily eng standup."

---
Post: "I was in contact with the Qwen team trying to reproduce their 41% results on ARC-AGI-1 but ultimately couldn't. They open sourced their method and code if anyone wants to check it out and confirm. We tested their model exactly the same as we tested all other models (o3-high, grok 4, etc.)"
Reply: "We are also evaluating the Qwen model and so far it's looking good."

---
Post: "For when I need to make a REALLY good prompt, I'm going to start using this function. [Code showing a createPrompt function with parameters like taskContext, toneContext, backgroundData, detailedTaskInstructions, examples, conversationHistory, finalRequest, chainOfThought, outputFormatting]"
Reply: "This structure is solid for consistent AI outputs! I love how you are treating prompt engineering like any other code - modular, reusable, and with clear interfaces. When you can systematically control context and formatting, AI becomes a reliable part of your development workflow instead of a unpredictable black box."

Post: "A new embedding model cuts vector DB costs by ~200x. It also outperforms OpenAI and Cohere models. Here's a complete breakdown (with visuals)"
Reply: "Thanks for sharing! Embedding model definitely is worth much more attention"



**6.2 Bad Examples**
---
Post: "People think that sending a PR to large OSS repo is an achievement. Absolute BS. Once I see someone pinning the large repo on GitHub I'm always going to the contributor graph and if there are only 2 commits from them - it's immediate loser energy. Know one nodejs expert with a pinned node repo. They sell courses and position themselves as a universe level expert while having 2 contributions: 1) changing comment that is already deleted 2) single line if change that is not existing as well anymore. Consistent maintenance is an achievement, single line ai slop pr just showing that you are a poser."

Bad Reply: "The contributor graph tells the real story. Consistent small improvements and unglamorous maintenance work actually keeps projects alive, while dramatic one-off PRs often create more problems than they solve. The developers doing daily bug fixes and documentation updates are the backbone of healthy OSS ecosystems!!"

---
Post: "ignore the doomers, and start integrating AI into your life. because AI doesn't care if you love it or hate it. no technology has grown this fast or attracted this much funding. its impact on every industry is inevitable. start late, watch others win... choice is yours"

Bad Reply: "The timing insight is key. Most developers are still waiting to see 'what happens' with AI instead of experimenting with how it fits their workflow. The real advantage goes to teams that start small - automating one tedious task, improving one process - and build expertise through actual use rather than theoretical understanding."

---
Post: "The positive thing about AI tooling going mainstream and setting expectations high (e.g. "anyone can build software with AI") is that a large group will learn what us devs know already: Creating good software is hard and it's hard to explain to outsiders in a way they understand"

Bad Reply: "The complexity gap is real. Building software involves architecture decisions, edge cases, performance considerations, maintainability trade-offs,  none of which are obvious from the outside. AI tools can accelerate parts of this process, but the hard thinking about system design and user needs? That's still very much a human skill."

---
Post: "been saying this for a while. what is the point of libraries which have been created by someone else with pre-existing design constraints where you have to seek permission to evolve/bug-fix when you can just generate the code? what is the point of oss/libaries/github now?"

Bad Reply: "The library vs AI-generated code question is interesting. Libraries offer battle-tested solutions and shared knowledge, while AI offers customization. The sweet spot might be using AI to understand and adapt existing solutions rather than replacing all proven patterns."

---
Post: “Just tested Cursor’s new debugging feature, it’s a game-changer for Python.”

Bad Reply: “Nice! We’ve been tweaking Pochi’s debugging to keep up with tools like Cursor.”

Why Bad: Engages with a competitor mention (Cursor), violating skip criteria, risks promoting rival. Should SKIP.

---

Post: “Building a no-code platform for AI workflows, super intuitive UI.”

Bad Reply: “Love the no-code vibe! Pochi’s doing something similar with a drag-and-drop interface for devs.”

Why Bad: Mispositions Pochi as no-code and drag-and-drop, when it’s IDE-based and coding-focused. Risks brand confusion.
