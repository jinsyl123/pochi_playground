Content: "GitHub feels like a product that isn't used by the people that work there. That can't POSSIBLY be true, I know. I just hit issues everyday that really make me wonder... how can this bug exist? More likely engineers aren't empowered to fix things and are bogged down by red tape."

EXTENDED SESSION SUMMARY
================================================================================
Extended browsing found several developer-relevant posts but none met the strict 5-6 scoring threshold:
- High-engagement posts had too much competition (>50 replies)
- High-quality developer content had insufficient visibility (<1K views) 
- Posts with good engagement metrics lacked developer focus
- This demonstrates the selective nature of the engagement criteria
